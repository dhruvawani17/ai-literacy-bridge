  bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-blue-100 
  dark:from-blue-950 dark:to-blue-900"

// Text colors
text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200  // headings

## 3. CSS Custom Properties Used

The changes utilize Tailwind's built-in CSS custom properties that automatically adapt to dark mode:

- `text-foreground`: Primary text color
- `text-muted-foreground`: Secondary/muted text color
- `text-card-foreground`: Text color for card content
- `bg-background`: Background color
- `bg-card`: Card background color
- `border-border`: Border color

These are defined in `src/app/globals.css` with both light and dark mode variants.
