# Firebase Setup Guide for AI Literacy Bridge

## üî• Firebase Configuration & Firestore Security Rules

This guide will help you set up Firebase for the AI Literacy Bridge project and fix the "Missing or insufficient permissions" error.

## Problem: Firebase Permission Errors

If you're seeing errors like:
```
FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

This means your Firestore security rules need to be configured.

---

## Solution Steps

### 1. Deploy Firestore Security Rules

The project includes a `firestore.rules` file with proper security rules. Deploy it to your Firebase project:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if you haven't
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in your project (if not already done)
firebase init firestore

# Deploy the security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 2. Alternative: Manual Rule Setup via Firebase Console

If you prefer to use the Firebase Console:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** ‚Üí **Rules**
4. Copy and paste the contents of `firestore.rules` file
5. Click **Publish**

## üîí Security Rules Explanation

The `firestore.rules` file includes:

### **Public Read Access** (for matching purposes)
- Students and Scribes profiles are publicly readable
- This allows the matching algorithm to work without authentication
- Sensitive data should be stored in a separate private collection

### **Authenticated Write Access**
- Only authenticated users can create profiles
- Users can only update/delete their own data
- Admins have full access

### **Collections Covered**
- `/students/` - Student profiles
- `/scribes/` - Scribe profiles
- `/exams/` - Exam information
- `/matches/` - Scribe-student matches
- `/users/` - User accounts
- `/admins/` - Admin management
- `/stats/` - Analytics data

## üß™ Testing in Development

### Option 1: Use Mock Mode (No Firebase Required)
The code now gracefully handles Firebase permission errors by falling back to mock data in development.

### Option 2: Use Firebase Emulator
For local development with Firebase:

```bash
# Install emulator
firebase init emulators

# Start emulator
firebase emulators:start
```

Then update your `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_USE_EMULATOR=true
```

### Option 3: Use Test Mode (Temporary)
For quick testing, you can temporarily set Firestore to test mode:

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: Do not use test mode in production!**

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

---

## üìã Environment Variables Required

Make sure your `.env.local` file has all Firebase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

Get these from:
1. Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí General
2. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
3. Select your web app or create one
4. Copy the config values

## üöÄ Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Firebase security rules are deployed
- [ ] Environment variables are set in production
- [ ] Authentication is properly configured
- [ ] Test mode is disabled
- [ ] Admin accounts are created
- [ ] Backup strategy is in place

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Error: "Firestore not initialized"
- Check that environment variables are set
- Verify Firebase config in `src/lib/firebase.ts`
- Check browser console for initialization errors

### Error: "Permission denied"
- Deploy/update security rules
- Verify user is authenticated for protected operations
- Check that the user has the correct role

### Error: "Project not found"
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` is correct
- Check that the project exists in Firebase Console

## üí° Development vs Production

### Development
- Uses fallback mock data if Firebase is not configured
- Logs warnings instead of throwing errors
- Allows testing without Firebase setup

### Production
- Requires proper Firebase configuration
- Enforces security rules
- Uses real authentication and authorization
