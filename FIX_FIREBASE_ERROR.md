## âœ… What This Does

Deploys the security rules from `firestore.rules` to your Firebase project, which:
- âœ… Allows public read access to student/scribe profiles (for matching)
- âœ… Requires authentication for creating/updating data
- âœ… Protects user data with owner-only access
- âœ… Enables admin accounts for management

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Verify It Worked

After running the command:

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. **Check the console** - error should be gone
3. **Test the app** - try creating a profile

If you still see errors:
- Check that you deployed to the correct Firebase project
- Verify your `.env.local` has the right `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- Run `firebase projects:list` to see your projects

## ðŸ§ª Alternative: Use Mock Mode

Want to develop without Firebase? The app already works in mock mode!

**What's Mock Mode?**
- App runs with sample data
- No real database needed
- Perfect for UI development
- Automatic fallback when Firebase isn't configured

**When to use it:**
- Working on design/layout
- Don't have Firebase set up yet
- Offline development
- Quick prototyping
