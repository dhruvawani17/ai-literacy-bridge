In algebra, we work with variables (like x and y) to represent unknown numbers. Here's how to approach this:

1. **Identify** what the problem is asking for
2. **Set up** equations using the given information  
3. **Solve** step by step using algebraic rules
4. **Check** your answer by substituting back

For grade ${context.grade} students, remember that algebra is like solving puzzles - each step gets you closer to the answer. Would you like me to walk through a specific example?`

    if (prompt.includes('geometry')) {
      return `${intro}

Geometry helps us understand shapes, sizes, and spatial relationships. Here's what's important:

üî∫ **Key Concepts:**
- Points, lines, and angles are the building blocks
- Area tells us how much space is inside a shape
- Perimeter is the distance around the outside
- Volume measures how much a 3D shape can hold

For your grade level, focus on visualizing the shapes and understanding how they relate to real objects around you. What specific geometry topic would you like to explore?`

    return `${intro}

Mathematics is a powerful tool for solving real-world problems. Whether we're working with:
- **Numbers and Operations** (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- **Patterns and Algebra** (finding unknowns, working with variables)
- **Geometry** (shapes, measurement, spatial reasoning)
- **Data and Statistics** (collecting, organizing, and interpreting information)

Each area builds on the others. What specific math topic can I help you with today?`

Physics studies matter, energy, and how they interact. Key concepts include:

‚ö° **Energy**: The ability to do work or cause change
üèÉ **Motion**: How objects move through space and time  
üîã **Forces**: Pushes and pulls that change motion
üåä **Waves**: How energy travels (sound, light, etc.)

Real-world connections: Physics explains everything from why balls bounce to how smartphones work! What physics concept interests you most?`
    }

    if (prompt.includes('chemistry')) {
      return `${intro}

Chemistry is the study of matter and how it changes. Think of it as the "recipe book" of the universe!

üß™ **Key Ideas:**
- **Atoms**: The tiny building blocks of everything
- **Elements**: Pure substances made of one type of atom
- **Reactions**: When substances combine or break apart
- **States of Matter**: Solid, liquid, gas (and plasma!)

You see chemistry everywhere - cooking, cleaning, even breathing! What chemical process would you like to understand better?`
    }

    return `${intro}

Science is all about asking questions and finding answers through observation and experimentation. Whether we're studying:
- **Life Science** (plants, animals, ecosystems)
- **Physical Science** (matter, energy, forces)  
- **Earth Science** (weather, rocks, space)

The scientific method helps us learn: observe, question, hypothesis, experiment, analyze, conclude. What scientific mystery shall we investigate today?`

üìù **Grammar Basics:**
- **Nouns**: People, places, things, or ideas
- **Verbs**: Action words or states of being
- **Adjectives**: Words that describe nouns
- **Adverbs**: Words that describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs

Think of grammar as the rules that help everyone understand each other. Just like games have rules to make them fun and fair, language has rules to make communication clear and effective.

What specific grammar concept would you like to practice?`

‚úçÔ∏è **Good Writing Tips:**
1. **Plan First**: Think about your main idea before you start
2. **Organize**: Put your thoughts in logical order
3. **Be Clear**: Use simple, direct language
4. **Show, Don't Tell**: Use specific details and examples
5. **Revise**: Read your work and make it better

Remember: Every great writer started as a beginner. The more you practice, the better you'll become! What kind of writing are you working on?`

üìö **Key Areas:**
- **Reading Comprehension**: Understanding what you read
- **Writing Skills**: Expressing your ideas clearly
- **Speaking & Listening**: Communicating with others
- **Literature**: Learning from stories and poems

üèõÔ∏è **Why Study History:**
- Learn from past successes and mistakes
- Understand different cultures and perspectives  
- See how societies change over time
- Connect past events to current situations

üîç **Historical Thinking:**
- **Cause and Effect**: What led to major events?
- **Change and Continuity**: What changed and what stayed the same?
- **Perspective**: How did different people experience events?
- **Evidence**: What sources tell us about the past?

History isn't just memorizing dates - it's about understanding people and their choices. What historical period or event interests you most?`
